         Historical data processing from Uruguay's open data portal is incorporated. <br>
         The graphs showing the history of vaccines are again incorporated. <br>
         Progress in integration continues. <br>

         Momentary adaptations are made to achieve a minimum version with the data that is currently accessible from MSP. <br>
         There are data stored and incorporated by vaccineUY that complement the information. <br>
         The site will return to its fullness when all the remaining information is accessible again. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>05/25/2021 18:00</b><br>
         MSP has disabled access to much of the information that makes the site vaccina.uy possible. <br>
         The changes prevent us from continuing to report the progress data of our vaccination. <br>
         Vacuna.uy will stop reporting until MSP provides some information access mechanism <br>

         MSP reports that the problem is due to changes and improvements in its service. <br>
         Part of the improvements will be the publication of information through Uruguay's open data regulations.<br>
         As soon as the migration has been carried out, work will begin on obtaining the necessary data from official sources.<br>
         The process can take time, in the meantime, if you want to monitor the vaccination status in Uruguay <br>

## About

This project was created by [@3dgiordano](https://github.com/3dgiordano) to publicize the Covid-19 vaccination information carried out in Uruguay.

It was born as a collaboration to provide updated data to [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)

Thanks to Edouard Mathieu [@edomt](https://github.com/edomt) Head of Data at [@owid](https://github.com/owid) for trusting in this project.

Data gathered from Ministry of Public Health of Uruguay. [https://monitor.uruguaysevacuna.gub.uy/](https://monitor.uruguaysevacuna.gub.uy/)

Data on deaths is obtained from the "Grupo Uruguayo Interdisciplinario de Análisis de Datos (GUIAD)" [GUIAD-COVID Data on GitHub](https://github.com/GUIAD-COVID/datos-y-visualizaciones-GUIAD/tree/master/datos) 

Our World in Data takes our data to publish it on its portal [Uruguay Covid-19 Vaccinations in Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=~URY)

Today, the project also collects more data, such as detailed daily vaccination data for each region, as well as the expected daily agenda.

All data is public, you can access the raw data and create your own reports if you want [/data/](https://github.com/3dgiordano/covid-19-uy-vacc-data/blob/main/data/)

The data generated is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and the Source Code under [MIT](https://github.com/3dgiordano/covid-19-uy-vacc-data/blob/main/LICENSE)
